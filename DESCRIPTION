Title: Cache R objects easily without dependency management

Description: Wrap functions in the result_cacher function to make it be
executed for any combination of arguments only once; subsequent calls to that
combination of arguments will be read from the cache. There's no form of
dependency management whatsoever, so think twice before applying this system to
large projects with many (inter)dependencies.
